# Simple ToDo App

Here is my first ToDo App built in Flutter using [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive_ce) package as a database and a [Time Picker](https://pub.dev/packages/bottom_picker). The design of the application was inspired by [TODO App](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1072981172023301059) designed by Eco Studios and CÃ©ss White.
